Explanation:
components/ Directory: This is where your reusable UI components like VerticalMenu.tsx and DynamicForm.tsx are placed. These components can be used in multiple places within your application.

VerticalMenu.tsx: This component is your vertical menu that contains navigation links or buttons. It's responsible for rendering the menu and handling user interactions, like clicking on a menu item.

DynamicForm.tsx: This component takes a JSON configuration and dynamically generates a form. It's used in the InputPage.tsx component to render input forms based on the menu selection.

views/ Directory: Contains components that represent entire pages, like InputPage.tsx and OutputPage.tsx. These pages use components from the components/ directory to assemble the layout and functionality of each page.

App.tsx: This is where you set up routing and render the VerticalMenu alongside the main content of your application.

index.tsx: The entry point of your React application, where you render the App component into the DOM.

By following this structure, you maintain a clear separation of concerns, making your code more manageable and scalable. The components/ directory holds individual UI elements, while the views/ directory contains the composition of these components into complete pages. This approach enhances the readability and maintainability of your code.

Explanation of Key Directories:
public/: Contains assets that are publicly accessible. index.html in this folder is the HTML file where your React app is mounted.

src/: Contains all the source code for your application.

components/: Reusable UI components. Splitting your UI into components helps in managing them easily.
context/: Contexts for React's Context API, useful for passing down data to deeply nested components.
services/: Business logic and functions for data processing, API calls, etc.
types/: TypeScript type definitions and interfaces. It's a good practice to separate type definitions for better readability.
utils/: Utility functions which can be used across different components or services.
App.tsx: The root component of your React application.
index.tsx: The entry point to your application. It's where you render your App component to the DOM.
.gitignore: A Git configuration file that tells Git which files or folders to ignore in your project.

package.json: Contains metadata about the project, such as dependencies, scripts, and version.

tsconfig.json: Configuration file for TypeScript, specifying compiler options and project settings.

README.md: A markdown file where you document the overview, setup instructions, and other important information about your project.
Key Additions for Authentication:
services/authService.ts: This file will handle authentication-related logic, such as signing in, signing out, and managing user sessions.

views/LoginPage.tsx and views/RegisterPage.tsx: These components represent the login and registration pages, respectively. They will interact with authService.ts to authenticate users.

Further Details:
components/common/: This directory is used for common components that are reused throughout the application, like buttons, input fields, modals, etc.

views/: This directory contains components that represent whole pages of your application, offering a clearer distinction between reusable UI components (components/) and the views or pages (views/).

Context API: If you're managing authentication state (like current user information), you might use React's Context API to make this state accessible throughout your application.

Utility Functions and Custom Hooks: You may find it beneficial to create custom hooks for authentication-related tasks, which can be placed in utils/ or a dedicated hooks/ directory.

Remember, this structure is a starting point and can be adapted based on the specific needs and scale of your project. For instance, if your application grows significantly, you might consider breaking down the services/ and components/ directories further or introducing more specific contexts or state management solutions.
